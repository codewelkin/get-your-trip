                    We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
                    necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy policy, unless a
                    longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
                    accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this policy will
                    require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period
                    of time in which users have an account with us.

                    When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
                    information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if
                    this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has
                    been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
                    information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
                    possible.
