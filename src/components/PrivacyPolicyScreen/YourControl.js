                    Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
                    include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
                    feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to
                    have data about your online browsing activities
                    monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for
                    recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been
                    finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or
                    any other mechanism that automatically
                    communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online
                    tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                    the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
                    this privacy privacy.
